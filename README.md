## FlashBSD
### Note that this is a hobby project that I made when I was bored on a Saturday evening. I know it could be useless to many but I just got tired of using the command line all the time to flash disks
### Also because of the absence of GUI USB Flashing tools on the BSD's in general

YAD and BASH are reqired: 
```pkg install yad bash```
```pkg_add yad bash```
```pkgin install yad bash```

```fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/es-j3/flashbsd/flashbsd.sh```
```chmod +x flashbsd.sh```
```bash flashbsd.sh```
