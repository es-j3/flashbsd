## FlashBSD
### Note that this is a hobby project that I made when I was bored on a Saturday evening. I know it could be useless to many but I just got tired of using the command line all the time to flash disks
### Also because of the absence of GUI USB Flashing tools on the BSD's in general

YAD is the only dependency: 
```pkg install yad```
```pkg_add yad```
```pkgin install yad```
